    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>Going into the project I tried to base elements of the Giphy Finder and the sketch design that I wanted to do. I
        wanted to use the Amiibo figurines itself to create a background and a headline for the project.

    </p>
    <p>When designing the site I had to make a lot of modifications in order to get the API to display. Therefore, my
        design changed from what I initially wanted to design. I put in all the backgrounds, header background, and gave
        a gradient background for the Amiibo type to be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>When having the my milestone checkpoint, I did not do much besides making changes to the backgrounds. The API
        also was not displaying correctly at the time either. It still looked like the Giphy finder. Also, the font I
        wanted to use wasn't working properly.

    </p>
    <p>My final process was to make drastic modification. I was able to get my font to work, in which I realized the
        font needed to be in the same folder as the style sheet. My API also worked properly, so that I could display
        the data that I wanted to. I also rechanged my background image so it wouldt have the same background as the
        image result background.

    </p>

    <p>I also saved the local storage information, so when switching between “tabs” it keeps the last saved data. The
        saved local storage will also work when closing the browser as well.

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>For the final submission, I was unable to have an additional control. However, I left the extra additional
        control on the page. Clicking on it will not doing anything. The way I was going to solve this was by using the
        sort method. However, I would need to move some code around to put the search term into an array, in order to
        use the sort method.

    </p>

    <h2>Meeting the Requirements</h2>
    <p>For the final submission, I have a working API, for both tabs. Each of the tabs will look into the API keys and
        will store the most recent search to the local storage. I have all the controls needed, except for an additional
        control. Please see note for the additional control.
